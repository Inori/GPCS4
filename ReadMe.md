# GPCS4

A Playstation 4 emulator just begin.  
A project for fun, and technical research.  

The only reason I start this project is learning 3D graphics, nothing serious.

## Latest progress

![Demo](https://github.com/Inori/GPCS4/blob/master/Misc/demo.gif)  

First texture rendered, [with hand write shaders](https://github.com/Inori/GPCS4/blob/master/Misc/tex.frag).  
The renderer code is just some test code without any design, and full of bugs, but I can get all the vertex buffers, textures and shader bytecode running so far.  
Next I will focus on the shader translator.
