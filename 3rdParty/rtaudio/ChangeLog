      * Additions and fixes for realtime operation: (Tim E. Real of MusE)
        - Added realtime operation to Pulse driver.
        - Fixed ALSA realtime support. Attributes are once again all set
           in probeDeviceOpen().
        - Fixed OSS realtime support. Same mods as done to ALSA driver.
          OSS untested, but should work, it's the same code.
        - A diagnostic message (streamed to cerr) in each of the callback
           handlers informs the user if realtime is really running.
