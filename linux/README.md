# Linux build draft

**This is only a draft now, for testing purpose only, no support.

Some code are motified brutally for this test.**

There may not be a `Makefile` or something else which directly builds GPCS4 in the future.

Or even this branch will not exist.

I may use `CMake`, `autogen` or whatever else to configure & build after functions are properly implemented for linux.

Tons of issues, do not list them now.

## Build environment

Requirments are near to the Windows environment.
* ubuntu 20.04
* clang 9.0.1
